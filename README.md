# arctic-flaming-monkey-typhoon
A deep learning library built on/to be used in conjunction with PyTorch

## Purpose
I created this library because moving from Keras to PyTorch, I found PyTorch to be far more flexible but missed some of the ease-of-use from the former.  I wanted something that would not only make creating deep neural nets easier, but that I could use interchangeably with pure PyTorch for maximum flexibility.  Thus, I decided to take a more functional approach with functions operating on PyTorch-compatible datatypes whenever possible.  I also wanted a set of utilities for things like memory optimization, so that's in there too.  And of course, I wanted something that was my own, so I could make it the way I liked it and continue to gain knowledge and experience with deep learning and PyTorch.

## State of the Project
My goal is to actually try and keep the master branch working at all times (shocking!), but I will be adding to/modifying this library as I continue to use it to expand and refine its functionality.

## The Name
I wanted to name this library something cool, preferably something that played on the whole fire theme from PyTorch.  So I came up with a few great ideas for cool sounding fire-related names.  All were taken.  So I came up with more ideas, but those were taken too.  So I gave up and named it something that makes no sense at all, but at least it sounds cool.
